            <h2>Theories About Space</h2>
            
            <!-- Big Bang Theory -->
            <div class="theory">
                <h3>Big Bang Theory</h3>
                <p>The universe began from an extremely hot and dense state about 13.8 billion years ago and has been expanding ever since.</p>
            </div>

            <!-- Steady State Theory -->
            <div class="theory">
                <h3>Steady State Theory</h3>
                <p>The universe has always existed in a constant state, with continuous creation of matter to keep the density constant as the universe expands.</p>
            </div>

            <!-- Multiverse Theory -->
            <div class="theory">
                <h3>Multiverse Theory</h3>
                <p>Our universe is just one of many universes that exist in a larger multiverse, each with potentially different physical laws and constants.</p>
            </div>

            <!-- Inflationary Theory -->
            <div class="theory">
                <h3>Inflationary Theory</h3>
                <p>The universe underwent an exponential expansion in its early moments, explaining its large-scale uniformity and isotropy.</p>
            </div>

            <!-- String Theory -->
            <div class="theory">
                <h3>String Theory</h3>
                <p>Fundamental particles are one-dimensional "strings" that vibrate at different frequencies to give rise to different particles.</p>
            </div>

            <!-- M-Theory -->
            <div class="theory">
                <h3>M-Theory</h3>
                <p>An extension of string theory that includes 11 dimensions and unifies the five different string theories.</p>
            </div>

            <!-- Quantum Loop Gravity -->
            <div class="theory">
                <h3>Quantum Loop Gravity</h3>
                <p>Attempts to quantize gravity by describing spacetime as a network of finite loops, removing the need for a background space and time.</p>
            </div>

            <!-- Dark Matter and Dark Energy -->
            <div class="theory">
                <h3>Dark Matter and Dark Energy</h3>
                <p>Dark Matter is an invisible substance that affects the universe's structure. Dark Energy is thought to be responsible for its accelerated expansion.</p>
            </div>

            <!-- Ekpyrotic Universe -->
            <div class="theory">
                <h3>Ekpyrotic Universe</h3>
                <p>Proposes that the universe was created from the collision of two three-dimensional branes in a higher-dimensional space.</p>
            </div>

            <!-- Cyclic Model -->
            <div class="theory">
                <h3>Cyclic Model</h3>
                <p>The universe undergoes endless cycles of expansion and contraction, with each cycle being a new Big Bang followed by a Big Crunch.</p>
            </div>

            <!-- Plasma Cosmology -->
            <div class="theory">
                <h3>Plasma Cosmology</h3>
                <p>Argues that electromagnetic forces, rather than gravity alone, play a significant role in the structure and behavior of the universe.</p>
            </div>

            <!-- Loop Quantum Cosmology -->
            <div class="theory">
                <h3>Loop Quantum Cosmology</h3>
                <p>Applies loop quantum gravity principles to cosmology, suggesting that the universe underwent a bounce rather than a singular Big Bang.</p>
            </div>
        </section>

        <section id="future">
            <h2>Future Predictions</h2>

            <div class="prediction">
                <h3>Big Freeze</h3>
                <p>The universe will continue expanding, leading to a state of maximum entropy where stars burn out and galaxies drift apart.</p>
            </div>

            <!-- Big Crunch -->
            <div class="prediction">
                <h3>Big Crunch</h3>
                <p>The expansion of the universe may eventually reverse, causing everything to collapse back into a singularity.</p>
            </div>

            <!-- Heat Death -->
            <div class="prediction">
                <h3>Heat Death</h3>
                <p>The universe will reach a state of maximum entropy where all thermodynamic processes cease, leading to a cold, dark universe.</p>
            </div>

            <!-- Big Rip -->
            <div class="prediction">
                <h3>Big Rip</h3>
                <p>The accelerated expansion of the universe will eventually tear apart galaxies, stars, planets, and even atoms.</p>
            </div>

            <!-- Possible Singularity -->
            <div class="prediction">
                <h3>Possible Singularity</h3>
                <p>Black holes may grow and merge, potentially leading to a singularity, a point of infinite density where the known laws of physics break down.</p>

                <h3>Black Holes</h3>
                <p>Black holes have such strong gravitational forces that nothing, not even light, can escape once it crosses the event horizon.</p>
            </div>

            <!-- Gamma-Ray Bursts -->
            <div class="fact">
                <h3>Gamma-Ray Bursts</h3>
                <p>Gamma-ray bursts are intense bursts of gamma rays that can release as much energy in a few seconds as the Sun will emit over its entire lifetime.</p>
            </div>

            <!-- Rogue Planets -->
            <div class="fact">
                <h3>Rogue Planets</h3>
                <p>Rogue planets are planets that do not orbit any star and drift through the galaxy alone, potentially colliding with other objects.</p>
            </div>

            <!-- Cosmic Rays -->
            <div class="fact">
                <h3>Cosmic Rays</h3>
